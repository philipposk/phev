[STEP 1/2] Running EDS-focused country-level analysis...
This will aggregate data at country level and analyze EDS patterns.


=== EDS-FOCUSED COUNTRY-LEVEL ANALYSIS ===
Using best Random Forest: mtry=10, ntree=1000, nodesize=5

=== STEP 1: Loading Data ===
Loaded 265603 PHEV records
Loaded temperature data: 37 records
Temperature columns: Country, aver_temp, rain, gasoline_price, GDP, mileage, max_speed, density_km2, Area_km2, Rural%, charge_points, PEVs, km_motorway, km_national, km_tot, perc_motorway, MS, GDPperCapita, Price2020, Region, Region2, Region_EuroVoc, pop_in_urban_%, pop_in_interm_%, pop_in_rural_% 

=== STEP 2: Country-Level Aggregation ===
Country-level data: 29 countries

=== STEP 3: Merging Temperature Data ===
Using temperature column: aver_temp 
Temperature data merged for 0 countries

=== STEP 4: Preparing Features for Best RF Model ===
Country-level model data: 29 countries

=== STEP 5: Loading/Training Best RF Model ===
No saved model found, will train new model on country-level data
Training RF model on country-level data...
Trained RF model with 29 country-level records

=== STEP 6: Country-Level Predictions and Analysis ===
Country-level model performance:
  R² = 0.9503 
  RMSE = 0.6213 kWh/100 km

=== STEP 7: EDS Sub-Category Analysis ===
EDS categories by region:
# A tibble: 5 × 6
  eds_category        region   n_countries mean_eds mean_energy mean_temperature
  <chr>               <chr>          <int>    <dbl>       <dbl>            <dbl>
1 Medium EDS (20-50%) Central…           8     30.9        25.7              NaN
2 Medium EDS (20-50%) Northern           7     32.5        22.4              NaN
3 Medium EDS (20-50%) Other              2     26.8        22.7              NaN
4 Medium EDS (20-50%) Southern           6     36.0        22.3              NaN
5 Medium EDS (20-50%) Western            6     30.4        23.1              NaN

=== STEP 8: Saving Results ===

[STEP 2/2] Creating EDS-focused figures and maps...
This will generate visualizations of EDS patterns by country and region.

Note: Mapping packages not available. Will create non-map figures only.

=== CREATING EDS-FOCUSED FIGURES ===
Loaded country-level data: 29 countries

Creating Figure 18: EDS by Country...
